    <headline>Oil prices slip as refiners shop for bargains.</headline>
    <dateline>LONDON 1996-08-20</dateline>
    <text>
        <p>World oil prices slipped on Tuesday in a market where refiners stung by high crude premiums and poor margins
            began to bargain for a cheaper barrel.
        </p>
        <p>October futures for world benchmark Brent Blend crude from the North Sea closed down 38 cents at $20.43 a
            barrel after failing to break through the day's high of $20.80.
        </p>
        <p>&quot;There was a broad feeling in the market that Brent was overheated and had to come down,&quot; a trader
            said.
        </p>
        <p>On the unofficial Brent forward market, prompt differentials for Dated or physical Brent shrank, suggesting
            cargoes would fetch lower premiums in the weeks ahead. This could avert the risk of refineries running less
            crude through their systems to pump up the price of products.
        </p>
        <p>The market was also waiting for direction from U.S. stocks data due out later on Tuesday which is forecast to
            show a 1.3 million barrel build in heating oil and diesel stocks in the run-up to the winter season, when
            gasoline gives way to heating oil as the guiding light for crude prices.
        </p>
        <p>Low inventory builds in the United States were largely supportive of the North Sea and West African markets
            with 5.0 million barrels of distillate-rich North Sea grades heading trans-Atlantic in the last week alone.
        </p>

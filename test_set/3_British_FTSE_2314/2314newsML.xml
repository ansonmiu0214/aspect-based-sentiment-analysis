    <headline>British FTSE index closes at record 3,883 points.</headline>
    <dateline>LONDON</dateline>
    <text>
        <p>Britain's FTSE 100 stock index, which sank to its lowest level of the year a month ago, chalked up a record
            closing high Tuesday, led by retail stocks.
        </p>
        <p>&quot;You probably couldn't have forecast a better background for the equity market than the one we've
            currently got,&quot; said one stock trader. &quot;The market has a lot going for it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>The blue chip index closed 19.5 points higher at 3,883.2, surpassing the previous 3,872.9 record it set just
            last week.
        </p>
        <p>Gainers outweighed decliners by a margin of two to one but volume was a subdued 512.9 million shares as all
            eyes remained fixed on the outcome of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting Federal Open Markets
            Committee, which was meeting as the London market closed.
        </p>
        <p>Retail stocks which led an early advance were boosted by the latest economic figures which showed an
            improvement in British consumer sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>&quot;The consumer credit figures this morning showed another booming month -- the consumer is back with a
            vengeance,&quot; another trader said.
        </p>
        <p>But the return of the so-called &quot;feel-good factor&quot; in the retail sector may also reduce the
            likelihood of any further cuts in British interest rates, traders said.
